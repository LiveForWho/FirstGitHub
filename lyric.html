    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre>
        You were the shadow of my light
        Did you feel us
        Another start
        You fade away
        Afraid our aim is out of sight
        Wanna see us
        Alive
        Where are you now
        Where are you now
        Where are you now
        Was it all in my fantasy
        Where are you now
        Were you only imaginary
        Where are you now
        Atlantis
        Under the sea
        Under the sea
        Where are you now
        Another dream
        The monsters running wild inside of me
        I'm faded
        I'm faded
        So lost
        I'm faded
        I'm faded
        So lost
        I'm faded
        These shallow waters, never met
        What I needed
        I'm letting go
        A deeper dive
        Eternal silence of the sea
        I'm breathing
        Alive
        Where are you now
        Where are you now
        Under the bright
        But faded lights
        You set my heart on fire
        Where are you now
        Where are you now
        Where are you now
        Atlantis
        Under the sea
        Under the sea
        Where are you now
        Another dream
        The monsters running wild inside of me
        I'm faded
        I'm faded
        So lost
        I'm faded
        I'm faded
        So lost
        I'm faded</pre
